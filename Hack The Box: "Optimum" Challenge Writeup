# Hack The Box: "Optimum" Challenge Writeup

## Objective:
Exploit a vulnerable web application and escalate privileges to root.

## Step 1: Initial Scanning
- Ran nmap to identify open ports:
    ```bash
    nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>
    ```
- Found a web server running HTTP on port 80.

## Step 2: Exploiting HTTP File Upload Vulnerability
- The web application allowed unrestricted file uploads.
- Uploaded a malicious ASPX reverse shell.
- Triggered the shell by accessing the uploaded file via the web browser:
    ```bash
    http://<target_ip>/uploads/shell.aspx
    ```

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation
- Enumerated the system for privilege escalation opportunities and found an outdated Windows operating system.
- Used a known kernel vulnerability (MS16-032) to escalate privileges and gain root access.

## Lessons Learned:
- File upload vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain system access if proper validation and security checks are not in place.
- Keeping Windows systems up to date is crucial for preventing privilege escalation exploits.
