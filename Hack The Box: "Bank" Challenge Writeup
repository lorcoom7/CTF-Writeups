#Hack The Box: "Bank" Challenge Writeup
#Objective:

This challenge involved exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability on a bankâ€™s website to retrieve sensitive data and escalate privileges.

#Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance

    -Scanned the target website and found a login form vulnerable to SQL injection:

   ```bash sql
   ```bash ' OR '1'='1

    -Bypassed the login and accessed the internal dashboard.

#Step 2: Dumping Database Information

    -Exploited the SQL injection vulnerability to dump the database using sqlmap:

    ```bash
    ```bash'sqlmap -u "http://<target_ip>/login" --dbs

    -Extracted usernames and passwords from the database.

#Step 3: Cracking Passwords

    -Found hashed passwords and used John the Ripper to crack them:

    'bash
    'john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt

#Step 4: Privilege Escalation

    -Used the cracked admin credentials to log into the server via SSH.

#Lessons Learned:

    -SQL injection is still a major risk for web applications.
    -Secure password storage using strong hashing mechanisms is crucial to prevent credential leakage.
