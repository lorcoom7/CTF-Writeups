# Hack The Box: "Valentine" Challenge Writeup

## Objective:
Exploit a vulnerability in OpenSSL to retrieve sensitive information and escalate privileges.

## Step 1: Port Scan and Reconnaissance
- Performed a scan with nmap:
    ```bash
    nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>
    ```
- Found OpenSSL running on port 443 and SSH on port 22.

## Step 2: Exploiting Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)
- The OpenSSL version was vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability.
- Used a Python script to exploit Heartbleed and retrieve memory from the server:
    ```bash
    python heartbleed-exploit.py <target_ip> 443
    ```
- Retrieved sensitive data from the server, including SSH private keys.

## Step 3: Using the Stolen SSH Key
- Used the retrieved private key to log into the system as a user:
    ```bash
    ssh -i private_key user@<target_ip>
    ```

## Step 4: Privilege Escalation
- Enumerated the system and found the user had sudo privileges for certain commands.
- Used sudo to execute a command as root and gain full control over the system.

## Lessons Learned:
- Heartbleed allows attackers to extract sensitive information directly from a serverâ€™s memory.
- Always monitor and patch vulnerabilities in critical services like OpenSSL.
