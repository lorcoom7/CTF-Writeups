#TryHackMe: "Overpass" Challenge Writeup
#Objective:

Investigate a compromised Linux system, exploit an SSH service, and escalate privileges to root.

#Step 1: Initial Enumeration

-Scanned the target system using nmap:

    'bash
    'nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>

-Discovered open ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

#Step 2: Investigating the Web Server

-Accessed the web server and found a message indicating that the system had been compromised.
-Analyzed the web logs and found a password hash in the logs.

#Step 3: Cracking the Hash

-Used hashcat to crack the password hash:

    'bash
    'hashcat -m 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

-Obtained the password for the SSH service.

#Step 4: Logging into SSH

-Used the cracked credentials to log in via SSH:
    
    'bash
    'ssh user@<target_ip>

#Step 5: Privilege Escalation

-Found that the user had access to the /etc/shadow file, which contained hashed root passwords.
-Cracked the root password and logged in as root:

    'bash
    'su root

#Lessons Learned:

-Log files can leak sensitive information, including passwords and hashes.
-Always secure sensitive system files like /etc/shadow to prevent unauthorized access.
