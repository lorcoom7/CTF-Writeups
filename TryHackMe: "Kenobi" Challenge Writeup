# TryHackMe: "Kenobi" Challenge Writeup

## Objective:
Exploit a vulnerable Linux machine by targeting file sharing services (NFS/FTP) and escalating privileges.

## Step 1: Scanning and Enumeration
- Ran a port scan to identify open services:
    ```bash
    nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>
    ```
- Found FTP (21), SSH (22), and NFS (2049) running.

## Step 2: Exploiting FTP
- Connected to the FTP server using anonymous login:
    ```bash
    ftp <target_ip>
    ```
- Found sensitive files exposed on the FTP server, including /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa.

## Step 3: Mounting NFS Shares
- Discovered that the NFS share was accessible without authentication.
- Mounted the NFS share locally:
    ```bash
    sudo mount <target_ip>:/ /mnt
    ```
- Retrieved files from /mnt/home/kenobi and found the user flag.

## Step 4: Privilege Escalation
- Found a vulnerable version of ProFTPD running, which was susceptible to a known exploit.
- Used Metasploit to exploit the ProFTPD vulnerability and escalate privileges to root:
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    use exploit/linux/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec
    set RHOST <target_ip>
    run
    ```

## Lessons Learned:
- Misconfigured services like NFS can expose sensitive files.
- Outdated services are often prone to remote exploitation.
