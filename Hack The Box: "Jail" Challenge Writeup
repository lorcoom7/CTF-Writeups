# Hack The Box: "Jail" Challenge Writeup

## Objective:
To escape a restricted shell environment (jail) and gain root access on the machine.

## Step 1: Accessing the Restricted Shell
- Upon initial login, I was dropped into a restricted shell (rbash) where only a few commands were available.

## Step 2: Bypassing the Restricted Shell
- Found a way to bypass the restricted shell by exploiting the environment variable:
    ```bash
    env /bin/sh
    ```
- This command provided access to a full shell.

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation
- Used `sudo -l` to list commands that could be executed as root.
- Found that a vulnerable command could be executed without a password, allowing privilege escalation to root.

## Lessons Learned:
- Restricted shells like rbash can be easily bypassed if improperly configured.
- Always audit sudo permissions to ensure least privilege.
