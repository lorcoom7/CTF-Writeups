#TryHackMe: "Red" Challenge Writeup
#Objective:

Exploit a vulnerable Apache Struts server, gain access, and escalate privileges.

#Step 1: Port Scanning

-Used nmap to scan for open ports:

    'bash
    'nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>

-Found that port 8080 was hosting an Apache Struts service.

#Step 2: Exploiting Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638)

-The Apache Struts version was vulnerable to CVE-2017-5638, a remote code execution vulnerability.
-Used a Python script to exploit the vulnerability and gain a shell:

    'bash
    'python exploit-struts.py <target_ip> 8080

#Step 3: Privilege Escalation

-Enumerated the system using linpeas and found that the user had the ability to run sudo for all commands.
-Executed the following to gain root access:

    'bash
    'sudo su

#Lessons Learned:

-Web applications with known vulnerabilities like Apache Struts can lead to full system compromise.
-Itâ€™s essential to keep web servers up to date with security patches.
