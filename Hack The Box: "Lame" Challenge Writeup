# Hack The Box: "Lame" Challenge Writeup

## Objective:
Gain access to the target system by exploiting a vulnerable network service and escalate privileges to root.

## Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance
- Used nmap to scan the target system for open ports and services:
    ```bash
    nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>
    ```
- Discovered open ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 139 and 445 (SMB).

## Step 2: Exploiting SMB with Metasploit
- Discovered the system was running Samba version 3.0.20, which is vulnerable to a known exploit (CVE-2007-2447).
- Used the Metasploit usermap_script exploit to gain a shell:
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
    set RHOST <target_ip>
    exploit
    ```
- Successfully obtained a low-privileged shell on the system.

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation
- Checked for sudo privileges but found none.
- Discovered a local vulnerability (CVE-2009-1185) in the system's kernel that could be exploited for privilege escalation.
- Compiled and executed the exploit to escalate privileges to root.

## Lessons Learned:
- Outdated services like Samba pose significant risks if not regularly patched.
- Always check for local privilege escalation opportunities after gaining an initial foothold.
